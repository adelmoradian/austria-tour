Somewhere between work and studies, social life and relationships, latest tech trends and existential threats,
we seem to have lost the connection to our deeper self. Endlessly swinging between one and the other, we rarely
seem to have any spare attention for the soul, the more subtle part of our being.

Sometimes a little reminder goes a long way...

With the help of meditation, music and a daring dash of spontaneity, we hope to remind you of these subtleties and
give you joyful moments that can bring you closer to your deeper self.

Between the noise and beyond time, in the moment

Coming second half of July to **Graz, Klagenfurt, Innsbruck, Salzburg,**
**Linz, St.PÃ¶lten, Horn and Wiener Neustadt.**
