Swinging between work and studies, relationships and social life, tech trends and apocalyptic news,
we rarely remember the true nature of our lives.

In the moment is a day-long exhibition that, with the help of meditation, music, arts and crafts,
gives you that rare opportunity to let it all go and be closer to your true self.

> With your spirit. Between the noise and beyond time.
